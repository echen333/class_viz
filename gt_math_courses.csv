MATH 0399 - Support for Precalculus,Practicum for Learning Support students enrolled in MATH 1113 (Precalculus).,['MATH 1113']
MATH 0999 - Support for MATH 1111,"This Learning Support course provides corequisite support in mathematics for students enrolled in MATH 1111 â€“ College Algebra. Topics will parallel topics being studied in MATH 1111 and the course will provide support for the essential quantitative skills needed to be successful in MATH 1111. Taken with MATH 1111, this course provides an in-depth study of the properties of algebraic, exponential and logarithmic functions as needed for calculus. Emphasis is on using algebraic and graphical techniques for solving problems involving linear, quadratic, piece-wise defined, rational, polynomial, exponential and logarithmic functions.",['MATH 1111']
MATH 1111 - College Algebra,"This course provides an in-depth study of the properties of algebraic, exponential and logarithmic functions as needed for calculus. Emphasis is on using algebraic and graphical techniques for solving problems involving linear, quadratic, piece-wise defined, rational, polynomial, exponential and logarithmic functions.",[]
MATH 1113 - Pre-calculus,"This course is an intensive study of the basic functions needed for the study of calculus. Topics include algebraic, functional, and graphical techniques for solving problems with algebraic, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions and their inverses. May only be used for degree credit with departmental approval.",['MATH 1111']
MATH 1501 - Calculus I,Differential calculus and basic integral calculus including the fundamental theorem of calculus. Credit not allowed for both MATH 1501 and 1712.,"['MATH 1113', 'MATH 1501']"
MATH 1503 - Calculus I For Life Sci,"Differential and basic calculus: sequences, difference equations, limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, applications.  The topics parallel those of MATH 1501 with applications from life sciences.","['MATH 1113', 'MATH 1501']"
MATH 1504 - Calculus II For Life Sci,"Taylor approximations, introduction to differential equations, linear algebra, and introduction to multivariable calculus.  Motivating examples drawn from life sciences.","['MATH 1511', 'MATH 1503', 'MATH 1501']"
MATH 1512 - Honors Calculus II,The topics covered parallel those of 1502 with a somewhat more intensive and rigorous treatment.  Credit not allowed for both honors calculus and the corresponding regular calculus course.  Credit not allowed for both MATH 1512 and MATH 1522.  Credit not allowed for both MATH 1512 and MATH 15X2.,"['MATH 1511', 'MATH 1512', 'MATH 1522', 'MATH 1501']"
